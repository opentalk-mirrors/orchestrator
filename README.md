# OpenTalk Orchestrator

The Orchestrator manages scalable services in an OpenTalk deployment, similar to a loadbalancer. It proxies the internal
web APIs of orchestrated services and forwards requests towards the appropriate instance.

## Service endpoints

| Service       | Orchestrator endpoint |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Roomserver    | `/roomserver/`        |
| Recorder      | `/recording/`         |
| Transcription | `todo`                |

## How it works

The orchestrator proxies the internal APIs of connected orchestrated services. For the API caller, the orchestrator
appears to be a single instance of the proxied service.

When a supported service is started and it has an orchestrator is configured, the service will attempt to register at
the orchestrator. Once registered, the service sends an initial dump of its metrics (current load, managed resources,
etc.) to the orchestrator.

The orchestrator maintains this list of registered services and continuously receives metrics from each of them. Based
on the managed resources of a service, the orchestrator can decide to which instance a request must be forwarded.

### Roomserver Example

Assume that a client wants to join room `28be42...`. The client sends its `/room/28be42.../start` request to the
controller. The controller checks the users permissions and requests a room token from its configured roomserver. In an
orchestrator deployment, the configured roomserver of the controller would be the `/roomserver` endpoint of the
orchestrator.

The orchestrator receives the request and can now determine which roomserver this request should be forwarded to. If
room `28be42...` is already managed by one of the roomservers, the request is forwarded to that roomserver instance.
If none of the roomservers manage room `28be42...`, the instance with the lowest load is selected to host the new room.

### Signaling Proxy

Besides the web API proxying, the orchestrator also provides a signaling endpoint under `/roomserver/v1/signaling/{token}`
that proxies the signaling websocket between a client and the managed roomserver instances.

Neither the client nor the roomserver need a any configuration for this. When a client requests a token from a
roomserver through the orchestrator, the orchestrator injects its signaling URL as `public_url` into the roomservers
`RoomServerAccess` response.

## Configuration

Each orchestrated service has an `orchestrator` section in their respective config that must be configured to point to
the orchestrator of that deployment.

The orchestrator must know the API keys of its orchestrated services. All API keys of deployed services must be added to
the `services.keys` field in the orchestrator configuration file. A service with an unknown API key id will have its
registration declined.

When configuring the controller, each service configuration should point to the respective orchestrator endpoint of that
service. For example, use orchestrators roomserver url (`<orchestrator_url>/roomserver`) as url for the controllers
roomserver configuration.
